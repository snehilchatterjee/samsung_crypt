NIST:
Quantum-resistant digital signature (like SPHINCS+) and key encapsulation mechanisms,


Standardized so far:

Key encapsulation mechanism: CRYSTALS-Kyber {learning-with-errors (LWE) problem over module lattices}
Signature schemes: CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+



Some of the proposed solutions so far:

1) Learning with errors/ Ring learning with errors              {APPROVED}
2) Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation (SIKE &  SIDH)       {NOT APPROVED}
3) Leighton-Micali Signature scheme                             {APPROVED}


NIST:

1) CRYSTALS-Kyber (official implementation: https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber)


2) SIKE and SIDH are insecure and should not be used (https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/documents/round-4/submissions/SIKE-spec.pdf):
Because of the proposed key recovery attack proposed by Castryck and Decru (https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975)

Isogeny-based schemes use the mathematics of supersingular elliptic curves to create a Diffieâ€“Hellman-like key exchange.

Moriya and Fouotsa have independently proposed different approaches to modifying
SIDH to avoid the Castryck and Decru family of attacks, but both of these proposals severely degrade the
performance and key size of SIDH by at least an order of magnitude.

The general consensus at this time
is that there is no known variant of SIDH which both retains roughly the same performance characteristics
as what was originally proposed while also remaining secure.

"Although there are no other active isogeny-based candidates participating in the NIST standardization
process, we hope that research and development into isogeny-based cryptosystems will continue and that
the post-quantum research community will continue to support and participate in such work"

3) Leighton-Micali Signature scheme:
