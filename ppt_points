Problem with SIKE AND SIDH:
Castryck and Decru posted
a preprint [5] outlining an efficient classical key recovery algorithm against SIDH along with code
implementing the algorithm and demonstrating its practicality

Moriya [40] and Fouotsa [18] have independently proposed different approaches to modifying
SIDH to avoid the Castryck and Decru family of attacks, but both of these proposals severely degrade the
performance and key size of SIDH by at least an order of magnitude. 



Lamport Signature (is stateless)

Winternitz One Time Signature (Base of LMS and XMSS) 		{Stateful signature scheme - incorporates the previous output into the next iteration }



Key Findings:


1) KEM:

Encapsulate a private key for transportation

(Specifically Assymetric Key encryption is enefficent as compared to Symmetric)


2) Lattice Based Cryphtography:
demonstrating the strength of lattice-based approaches in quantum-safe cryptography.

3) Quantum-Safe Hash-Based Digital Signatures:
Groverâ€™s algorithm only provide a quadratic speedup for searching hash functions.

4) Ease of Implementation:
wrapper available in rust, java and python

5) Stateful Hash-Based Signature Schemes:
could not be implemented using the API that NIST has defined (which does not allow any state).

6) Special publication:
